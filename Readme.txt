This is the start of my portfolio website, once created I will host it on a domain.
There are 2 sides of the website, backend and frontend, The backend is python and will update to also have database.
The front end is just plain html and css.

When handling GET requests for files, the current working directory is always "SIMPLE WEBSITE" so change 
the html relative paths accordingly.

27/02 - added badApple application.
